# Data-Processing-and-Storage-Assignment

## Instructions to run code
To run the code, clone this repository into vscode. From there make sure you have a python extension and after that you can run the file to see the tests run.

## How to modify the assignment
For this to become an offical assignment I think there are some changes that can be made to make this better and more clear. I think the specifications are fine in explaining how to set up your code but I think it can be more clear on what is tested. Maybe providing some test cases that will be graded or more explicitly say that figure 2 is the tests that will be graded.
